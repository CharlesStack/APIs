      summary: Enable or Disable Two Factor Authentication
      description: >-
        This API call enables two factor authentication for the user.

        When initially enabling TFA, no credential payload is required.  The response, if successful, includes the URL that can be imported by an authenticator app as well as an QR Code image, mime-encoded, and in the desired format.

        The credential payload is required when disabling TFA.  If the useSMS=true was used, the code supplied in the SMS is what should be entered in the payload.
        If useSMS=false or omitted, the code supplied should be that generated by an authenticator.

        Only after the a valid TFA code is submitted via the payload will the desired action be taken.

        Note (1) - when disabling TFA, ALL methods for TFA are disabled and removed from the account.

        Note (2) - When enabling TFA, the authenticator link is supplied only once and is not recoverable by the user.  You must disable TFA and reenable it to get a new authenticator link.

            Enabling TFA is a two phase process.

            In phase=1, the desired action is specified as a query.  The response includes the URL for an authenticator app to use.
            In phase=2, the credentials are passed and include the a TFA code generated by the authenticator app to activate TFA on the account.

            Disabling TFA is,a one or two step process.
            If the TFA code is generated by an authenticator, it can be included in the body and the phase query param can be omitted or set to 1.
            If the TFA code is being sent via SMS (phase=1 and useSMS=true) then, upon receiving the SMS code, the code must be specified in the payload and the query parameters, phase=2 and useSMS=true, must be set.
