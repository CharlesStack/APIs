# APIs
A set of API specifications and associated documentation.

The first API microservice being developed is the User Management service.  When completed, it will be capable of creating users, managing those users, signing in and out of the service (and, by extension, other apps), and configuring Two-Factor authentication.

Two Specification documents were added under /UserAPI/Swagger.
The first is the Swagger_UserAPI.yaml file, which is a version of the spec that conforms to the Swagger 2.0 spec.
The second file is the OAS_UserAPI.yaml. It represents the same information as the Swagger doc but in OpenAPI format.
