# APIs
A set of API specifications and associated documentatio.

The first API and microservice being developed is the User Management service.  When completed, it will be capable of creating users, managing those users, signing in and out of an the service (and, by extension other apps), and configure Two-Factor authentication.

Two Specification documents were added under /UserAPI/Swagger.
The first is the Swagger_UserAPI.yaml file.  This is a version of the spec that is conformant to the Swagger 2.0 spec.
The second file is the OAS_UserAPI.yaml file.  This represents the same info as the Swagger doc but in OpenAPI format.
